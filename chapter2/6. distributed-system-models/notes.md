Distributed-System Models
--------------------------
- A process abstraction
- A link abstraction
- Failure-detector abstraction

- Fail-Stop
    - crash-stop process abstraction (deterministic)
    - Perfect links
    - Perfect failure detector (P)
- Fail-Noisy
	- crash-stop process abstraction
	- Perfect links
	- Eventually perfect failure detector (<>P) or Eventual Leader detector (Ω)
- Fail-Silent
	- crash-stop process abstraction
	- Perfect links
	- No failure detectors or leader election abstraction
- Fail-Recovery
	- crash-recovery process abstraction
		- process may forget what it did prior to crashing.
	- stubborn links
	- Eventual Leader detector (Ω)
- Fail-Arbitrary 
	-fail-silent-arbitrary
		- Arbitrary/Byzantine process abstraction
		- authenticated perfect link abstraction
	- fail-noisy-arbitrary
		- Arbitrary/Byzantine process abstraction
		- authenticated perfect link abstraction
		- Byzantine eventual leader-detector abstraction
- Randomized
	- non-determisistic
	- only way to solve a problem or to circumvent inherent inefficiencies of deterministic algorithms
