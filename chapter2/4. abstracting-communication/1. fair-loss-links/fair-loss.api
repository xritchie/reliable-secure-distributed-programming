Module:
	Name: FairLossPointToPointLinks, instance fll. 
Events:
	Request: ⟨ fll, Send | q, m ⟩: Requests to send message m to process q.
	Indication: ⟨ fll, Deliver | p, m ⟩: Delivers message m sent by process
Properties:
	FLL1: Fair-loss: If a correct process p infinitely often sends a message m to a correct process q, then q delivers m an infinite number of times.
	FLL2: Finite duplication: If a correct process p sends a message m a finite number of times to process q, then m cannot be delivered an infinite number of times by q.
	FLL3: No creation: If some process q delivers a message m with sender p, then m was previously sent to q by process p.
