Authenticated Perfect Links
----------------------------
- Arbitrary/Byzantine process abstraction (Recall that in this model, the communication links themselves may also behave arbitrarily)
- fair-loss point-to-point link abstraction
- finite duplication and no creation properties permit that if there is only one faulty process, a correct process may deliver any legal message an unbounded number of times and without any correct process previously having sent it.
